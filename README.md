- Open windows propmpt as admin and execute ```pip install robotframework-faker``` to install robotframework-faker.
- Open windows propmpt as admin and execute ```pip install setuptools``` to install setuptools package.
- Look for Robot Framework Language Server in the extensions marketplace and install the one from Robocorp.
- To set up GitHub Self-Hosted Runner:
  - Execute `mkdir actions-runner; cd actions-runner` to create and enter a folder for the runner.
  - Execute `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.326.0/actions-runner-win-x64-2.326.0.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.326.0.zip` to download the latest runner package.

  - Execute the checksum validation command ```Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ; [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD/actions-runner-win-x64-2.326.0.zip", "$PWD")``` to extract the installer.
  - Execute the command ```./config.cmd --url https://github.com/adrianoes/robotframework-and-skulix-calculator_desktop --token YOUT_TOKEN_HERE``` to create the runner and start the configuration experience.
  - Open PowerShell as admin and eceute the command ```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned``` to set the execution policy correctly.
  - Navigate to C:\actions-runner by using PowerShell > Execute the command ```./run.cmd``` to run the self-hosted runner. Commit the changes and wait for the tests to start being executed.

# Tests:

- Execute ```robot -d ./results tests``` to run all tests in headless mode and store results in separated folder.
- Execute ```robot -d ./results .\tests\add.robot``` to run all the tests in the add.robot suite in headless mode and store results in separated folder.
